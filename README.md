### Project Title

**Author**

#### Executive summary
Business Problem:
Based on the health data available for someone, identify if that person has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).
#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?

#### Data Sources
My dataset comes from the kaggle repository [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abrahamanderson/hearth-disease-prediction/datag).  
The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?

#### Results
I first analyzed, visualized, and then cleaned the data.

After that, I split the data for training and testing. I created 4 models with default values for KNN, DTree, logistic regression, and SVM. I see that the highest test accuracy is with Logistic regression and SVM, KNN was also comparable, but training time for SVM was really high, and for KNN, it was really low. Based on this I would go with logistic regression, but the data sample is really small, so we need to run these models with more data before concluding. 

Here is the result

    model   train_accuracy  test_accuracy   train_time (sec)
model	train_accuracy	test_accuracy	train_time (sec)	summary
0	KNN	0.867847	0.834906	0.009213
1	Dtree	1.000000	0.774764	0.032423
2	LGR	0.854572	0.857311	0.020705
3	SVM	0.857817	0.854953	0.354813


I then used GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning and did the training and testing again; below are the results. Now all models have comparable test accuracy, but training time had huge variance, SVM and KNN took a long time (I had to remove some of the parameters to make it finish on time). Logistic regression finished in only 0.5 sec.

model	train_accuracy	test_accuracy	train_time (sec)	
0	KNN	0.867847	0.834906	3.332418
1	Dtree	0.847788	0.852594	3.672317
2	LGR	0.854572	0.857311	0.506328
3	SVM	0.846608	0.853774	6.749078
